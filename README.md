PyPoll: Automation of vote counting from CSV files. Program was written to accept more than one .csv file in the supplied directory.

PyParagraph: Text analysis of prose passage, including word, sentence, word-per-sentence counts, and average sentence length. Implements two separate dictionary objects for the summary table (one specific to sentences and another specific to words).

# Notes
For both programs, as the docstring indicates, the "main.py" requires a command-line argument for the text file (in the case of PyParagraph) or directory (in the case of PyPoll)
