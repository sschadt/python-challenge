Python challenge homework

# Notes to TAs
For both challenges, as the docstring indicates, the main.py requires a command-line argument for the text file (in the case of PyParagraph) or directory (in the case of PyPoll)

For the PyPoll challenge, I wrote this as if there could be more than one .csv file in the supplied directory.

For the PyParagraph challenge, the order of the summary table is slightly different the what the example shows in the instructions, but since I decided to use a dictionary specific to sentences, and one specific to word, I grouped them as such.

Thanks for reading!
